# AstroBank

A website for a fictitious bank. Final assignment for Web development course.

Lumifylearn.com Course: ICT40120 - Certificate IV in Information Technology (Web Development)
This is my final project for this course and last assignment for the last unit.
I will be using:
PHP
HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT
JQUERY
MYSQL
I will develop the website locally using PHPmyadmin, Mysql, VSCode, Chrome and Figma.
The website will include some generic bank info and pages which will have no function except to link to each other.
I will include a user sign up and log in as well as allowing users to open new bank accounts. And also view their accounts.
This will include sign up, log in forms and a database to store and retrieve the data from.
Some dummy user data, accounts and transactions will be created for demonstration purposes.
I will also add a loan repayments calculator.

Setup:
1: Copy the ICTWEB440 folder into "C:\xampp\htdocs\"
2: Launch XAMPP control panel and start Apache and Mysql
3: Navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ in your browser.
4: Create a database called astrobank by importing the AstroBank sql file located in the "ICTWEB440_Review_Oenghus_Walsh\Database\" folder.
5: Navigate to http://localhost/ictweb440/astrobank/index.php
